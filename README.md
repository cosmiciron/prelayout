# prelayout

`prelayout` gives you text layout before you paint.

That is the whole trick, and it is a useful one. Browsers are great at drawing
text after the DOM has had its say. Prelayout is for the moments when you need
the answer first: where the text lands, what fit, what overflowed, which page it
belongs to, and what shape it had to dodge on the way there.

The backstory: I have been building the VMPrint engine mostly with automated
desktop publishing and serious live editing surfaces in mind. Then `chenglou`'s
`pretext` showed up and made a very clever point: developers want text answers
before rendering, not after a pile of DOM work. The only catch is that you
cannot build a house with just a measuring tape.

VMPrint is the bulldozer, forklift, and concrete mixer: a real DTP engine that
happens to be blazing fast and small. So `prelayout` wraps that engine in
`pretext`-inspired APIs that stay deliberately simple, headless, and stateless,
but stop a few steps later: not just measuring, not just asking "how big?", but
returning the actual layout pieces, continuations, shapes, and pages developers
deserve.

## Install

```bash
npm install @prelayout/prelayout
```

The package is `@prelayout/prelayout` because we believe in symmetry,
namespaces, and not fighting npm ghosts before breakfast.

## What You Get

The package returns engine-authored data:

- text pieces with `x`, `y`, `width`, `height`, text, baseline, and paint fields
- line guides for overlays and inspection
- occupied heights
- consumed and remaining text reports
- reusable exclusion shapes
- paginated pages from `produce()`

It does not ship a renderer. Your app can paint the results in HTML, canvas,
SVG, WebGL, native UI, or whatever contraption you are building this week. The
important part is that the layout answer came from the engine, not from a DOM
node quietly improvising in the corner.

## The API

```js
import {
  form,
  fit,
  flow,
  pour,
  produce,
  exclusion
} from "@prelayout/prelayout";
```

- `form(content, options)`: lay out a fragment and tell me how tall it is.
- `fit(content, options)`: lay out one bounded box and tell me what remains.
- `flow(content, targets)`: carry content through several bounded boxes.
- `pour(content, shape, options)`: fill text inside a shape.
- `produce(source, options)`: paginate a document or structured element payload.
- `exclusion`: build circles, rectangles, ellipses, polygons, alpha masks, and
  replayable exclusion assemblies.

Most text APIs take strings. Plain strings are plain text. Mixed-style text is a
structured JSON string. `produce()` is the page-minded one: it can also take a
full document object, an elements object, an elements array, or a JSON string
containing those shapes.

## Runtime

Prelayout is headless, but it is not currently server-runtime-free. The engine
uses browser text measurement, so layout calls need a browser-like environment
with Canvas text APIs. `OffscreenCanvas` is enough for basic measurement;
browser DOM font probes are used when CSS line-height metrics need them.

Importing the package in Node is fine, but calling `form()`, `fit()`, `flow()`,
`pour()`, or `produce()` in plain Node without browser canvas APIs will throw
`[prelayout] Browser canvas APIs are unavailable.`

## Tiny Examples

Ask how a fragment lays out:

```js
const result = form("Layout is data.", {
  width: 320,
  fontFamily: "Georgia, serif",
  fontSize: 18,
  lineHeight: 1.4
});

for (const piece of result.pieces) {
  console.log(piece.text, piece.x, piece.y, piece.width, piece.height);
}
```

Fit text into a bounded region:

```js
const result = fit(longText, {
  width: 360,
  height: 240,
  hyphenation: "soft"
});

console.log(result.content.consumed.text);
console.log(result.content.remaining.text);
```

Make pages:

```js
const pageResult = produce({
  elements: [
    { type: "p", content: "A document can become engine-authored pages." }
  ]
}, {
  width: 612,
  height: 792,
  margins: { top: 72, right: 72, bottom: 72, left: 72 }
});

console.log(pageResult.pages.length);
```

## Why Bother?

Because some interfaces need text layout as data, not as a side effect:

- editor overlays and source mapping
- selectable generated text
- paginated previews and document thumbnails
- shaped reading surfaces
- text that wraps around image or video silhouettes
- multi-panel flows where continuation matters
- infinite scrolling masonry, chat, feeds, timelines, and generated UI

The DOM can still paint the glyphs. We love the DOM. We just do not want it to
be the secret layout authority when the app needs exact answers.

## Performance

This also attacks a classic frontend tax: DOM thrashing. If the only way to
learn text size is to render, measure, mutate, render again, measure again, and
hope the browser is still speaking to you, the UI pays for it in layout
invalidations and frame drops. Prelayout lets you ask the engine for the layout
up front, then paint once. That is a big deal for infinite lists, masonry grids,
chat transcripts, live editors, and anything trying to stay smooth while content
keeps arriving.

The performance is the fun part. The HTML Atlas demo lays out a 334-page book,
with publishing-grade pagination, in about 600ms on a Surface Pro 11 tablet and
around 300ms on an M4 Max MacBook. The whole wall of pages then renders as plain
HTML in about 20ms and 10ms respectively. Trying to discover that same layout by
shoving hundreds of pages through DOM measurement would be a very efficient way
to make the browser reconsider its life choices.

The smaller interactive cases are just as telling. Moving irregular exclusion
shapes through a sea of text can take around 0.5ms to lay out on the Mac, with
rendering in the same neighborhood. So yes: the delightful "dragon swimming
through text" sort of demo is absolutely in reach here too, with a fraction of
the code and CPU. The difference is that nothing has to be hardcoded. The shape
moves, the engine solves, the UI paints.

## Footprint

The package stays small, too. A clean launch build currently packs to about
245 KiB on npm, unpacking to about 1.29 MiB across 18 files. The shipped runtime
JavaScript is about 1.11 MiB raw, 213 KiB gzip, or 164 KiB Brotli. That includes
the embedded layout engine. The declarations add about 175 KiB raw, or 30 KiB
gzip. Not bad for the bulldozer, forklift, concrete mixer, and a few useful
clipboards.

It matters even more for the next wave of interfaces. AI-generated UI and
generative interactions produce content on the fly: cards, answers, annotations,
summaries, previews, weird little custom surfaces nobody planned at design time.
Those systems need cheap, deterministic layout data before they decide what to
mount, recycle, stream, or animate. Prelayout gives them the answer without
making the DOM do the whole audition first.

## Run The Demos

```bash
npm run serve
```

The server starts at `http://127.0.0.1:4173/`.

Open `http://127.0.0.1:4173/demos/` for the demo index.

The public demo site runs the published npm package through an ESM CDN, so it
matches the package consumers install rather than importing private repo paths.

Current demos:

- `form`: width-bounded fragments and returned pieces
- `fit`: bounded layout with consumed and remaining content
- `flow`: continuation through multiple targets
- `pour`: text contained inside a primitive shape
- `pour-image`: text contained inside image-derived alpha geometry
- `pieces`: minimal piece and baseline inspection
- `exclusion`: live primitive exclusion fields
- `exclusion-image`: image alpha as wrap geometry
- `html-atlas`: `produce()` rendered as a searchable, selectable paginated atlas
- `dancing-text`: animated exclusion fields from video frames

The demos use browser import maps, so serve them from the repo root. Opening
the files directly from disk is an excellent way to meet the less charming parts
of browser module loading.

## Helpers

The npm package stays small. Browser image sampling, video frame extraction, and
HTML piece painting live as source files under
[demos/helpers](https://github.com/cosmiciron/prelayout/tree/main/demos/helpers).
They are official examples, but not package exports.

Copy them when they help. Change them when your app needs something slightly
different. The deal is simple: helpers may prepare explicit inputs or paint
returned results; they do not get to make up layout geometry.

## The One Rule

Prelayout is a thin wrapper around the engine. Every layout decision belongs to
the engine.

The short version:

- engine owns layout
- wrapper owns normalization and result projection
- helpers own adapter glue
- demos own inspection and presentation
- applications own rendering

If browser code starts inventing line breaks, baselines, page geometry, or
continuation behavior, it has wandered into engine territory. Gently escort it
back.
